Managing installed packages is a core \*nix-user skill. If you use Debian (or a Debian-derived Linux distro like Ubuntu) on servers you are probably familiar with `apt-get`, `apt-cache` and `dpkg`; or perhaps you have given in and turned to the text-ui of `aptitude`. APT, a tool that was originally released in 1998(!), got to version 1.0 in 2014(!!) and with the 1.0 release came a set of simpler commands for managing packages.

While it takes a little while for new versions of software to update in distros, it seems like it takes a lot longer for obsolete guides to APT to be pushed out of the top spots in the search engines. Of course you can still use the lower level tools (`apt-get`, `apt-cache` or even `dpkg`), but `apt` is probably easier in most cases.

So let's get to the good stuff, here are the new `apt`-commands you need the most:

* `apt search <terms>` -- search for packages, e.g `apt search zsh shell`
* `apt list <pkg> \[--installed\] \[--upgradable\] \[--all-versions\]` -- list packages, optionally installed, outdated or with all versions available locally, e.g. `apt list --upgradeable` or `apt list apache2 --all-versions`
* `apt show <pkg> \[--all-versions\]` -- show package information, e.g `apt show apache2`
* `apt install <pkg> \[\{=pkg_version_number | /target_release\}\]`  -- to install packages, _optionally_ a specific version or release (e g `testing` or `stable`), e.g, `apt install zsh/stable`
* `apt edit-sources` -- simple way to get to edit your sources.list
* `apt update` -- update package index files from sources (e.g after `apt edit-sources`)
* `apt upgrade` -- upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions
* `apt full-upgrade` -- do a smart upgrade of packages, taking dependencies into account (might remove dependencies)
* `apt remove <pkg>` -- remove package (but not configuration files), e.g `apt remove apt-doc`

Happy apt-ing!
